Module : OS.walk 




It generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up

For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top(including top itself), 

it yields a 3-tuple(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)

1. dirpath : Is a String, the path to the directory

2. dirnames : Is a list of the names of the subdirectories in dirpath(excluding '.' and '..').

3. filenames : It is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath

Module: fnmatch :

The fnmatch module compares file names against glob-style patterns such as used
by Unix/Linux shells.

These are not the same as the more sophisticated regular expression rules. 

Its purely a string matching operation.
